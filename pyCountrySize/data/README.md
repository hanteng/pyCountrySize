pyCountrySize Data Sources
=============
Internal:

country_name.xls

I develop this spreadsheet to integrate data sources through their ISO country codes. The problem is that many data sources use country names, and these names are often not consistent across different data sets. Therefore I need to map them into ISO country codes for consistent data integration.

WEOOct2014all.xls

This file is downloaded from [IMF World Economic Outlook Databases](http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28). This is the preferred datasource compared to UN databases because it contains countries such as Taiwan, which is among [the 30 largest economies in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29).
